# Sparse Estimation of Inverse Covariance Matrix using Approximate Message Passing (AMP)

This is the Github repository for hosting the codes and relevant materials for the ongoing publication work titled "Sparse Estimation of Inverse Covariance Matrix using Approximate Message Passing". The objective is to improve the Graphical Lasso Algorithm of Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani based on the use of AMP algorithm and its variants to solve the lasso regression problems arising at the intermediate steps of the Graphicla Lasso Algorithm.
